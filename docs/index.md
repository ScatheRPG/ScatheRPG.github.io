# Welcome to the Scathe TTRPG system

Scathe RPG is a new TTRPG system with a significant focus on dynamic, unique character
customization. Gameplay is intended to be quick, intense, and deadly while character building is
meticulous and careful without being overbearing. In this RPG, death awaits around every corner,
but the reward for survival and success is tremendous. An enemy getting the drop on you with a
knife could spell death no matter how powerful you are, but the reverse is true as well. Strategy
begins when you start building your character, but it does not end there.
