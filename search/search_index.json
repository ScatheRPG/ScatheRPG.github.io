Gameplay is intended to be quick, intense, and deadly while character building is meticulous and careful without being overbearing. In this RPG, death awaits around every corner, but the reward for survival and success is tremendous.

Strategy begins when you start building your character, but it does not end there.</p> <p>For more information visit wiki.aen.quest.
